## Moro Security

Moro scans, cleans, and anonymizes datasets using AI—aligned with OWASP LLM, ISO 27001, and GDPR—for secure, compliant, and audit-ready data operations.

## Privacy Policy

Moro processes your information in accordance with modern privacy standards, including **GDPR**, **ISO 27001**, and **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**. We use your email solely for early access notifications and product updates. Your data is never sold or used for advertising.

Our AI-based tools scan, clean, and anonymize datasets to support secure and compliant use of large language models (LLMs). All processing is optimized for data minimization and auditability, and no training data or sensitive metadata is retained without purpose.

By joining the waitlist or using Moro, you consent to our handling of your data for these specific purposes. You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us. Moro is committed to building privacy-first infrastructure for responsible AI.

## Terms and Conditions

By accessing or using Moro, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. Moro is an API-based service designed to scan, clean, and anonymize datasets to help teams build secure and compliant LLM workflows. Use of the platform is permitted solely for lawful, non-commercial purposes unless explicitly authorized.

You retain full ownership of your data. Moro acts as a processor only, and does not claim rights over the content you submit. However, you grant us a limited license to process that data strictly for the purpose of delivering our service (e.g., risk analysis, compliance scanning, anonymization).

Moro is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. While we implement strong safeguards and align with standards like OWASP LLM, GDPR, and ISO 27001, we do not guarantee legal compliance in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for verifying how Moro fits within your own regulatory obligations.
